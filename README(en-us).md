## Some Q&A
Q: Why client-side only?

A: Because there's already plenty of mods and plugins which works around the problem from server-side. To me, this function is more like a protection than a restriction, so I decided to develop a fully client-side mod to achieve this.

Q: Supported minecraft versions?/When will the mod be updated?

A: There's not much code in here, so I think it'll work fine on most modern minecraft version, although only 1.21.5 was tested. To the same reason, the mod would probably work fine in newer versions without making any changes.

If you've tested the mod in another version, please let me know.
